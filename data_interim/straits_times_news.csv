In a media reply, the national carrier said Flight SQ228 returned to the Australian airport shortly after take-off, and that it had dumped fuel to land within the landing weight.
The airline did not provide details of the issue faced on board.
The Boeing 777, carrying 219 passengers and 17 crew members, landed uneventfully at 5.47pm local time (2.47pm in Singapore) on Oct 29, said SIA. The flight had departed at 4.35pm local time.
All passengers and crew disembarked normally, it added. The passengers were provided with meal vouchers.
The airline’s ground engineering team is trying to resolve the issue, said SIA.
“SIA sincerely apologises to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused.
“The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority,” it said.
According to Flightradar24, a flight data site, the aircraft circled around the north of the Australian city before it headed back to the airport.
Several media outlets in Australia reported on the flight diversion, with one showing the aircraft landing safely at the airport.
“Shortly after take-off, the flight made the decision to return to Melbourne Airport due to a technical issue,” a Melbourne Airport spokesman told 7News.
“The plane landed under normal conditions... before taxiing safely to the gate.”
Witnesses called Melbourne news and talk station 3AW about the plane flying low over the eastern suburbs.
“It just flew over our house a few minutes ago. It was so low, you could see the wheels down and I waved at all the passengers as they went overhead. I’ve never seen a plane that low before. It was scary,” said a caller who identified himself as Sam.
“We saw it do a turn really low and I looked it up, it was (2km above us) dumping fuel and, yeah, redirecting back to Melbourne,” another caller named Gordon said.
Several people posted footage on social media of the plane flying with two white smoky trails emanating from the wings.
Facebook user All Areas Chauffeur Services posted a video of the plane, writing: “Was outside mowing the grass and heard a loud plane... Zooming in you can see half of the landing gear has failed to retract. I’m wondering if this was the issue.”

"Pakistan flag carrier resumes flights to Britain after five-year ban","https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/pakistan-flag-carrier-resumes-flights-to-britain-after-five-year-ban?ref=search-results","Oct 25, 2025, 6:17 PM","ISLAMABAD – Pakistan’s state-owned airline resumed direct flights to Britain on Oct 25, after the British authorities had ended a five-year suspension imposed over aviation safety concerns.
The debt-ridden flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was barred from flying to Britain, the European Union and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A320 aircraft plunged into a Karachi neighbourhood, killing nearly 100 people.
The deadly crash was blamed on human error.
Britain lifted restrictions on Pakistani carriers in July after concluding that aviation safety standards were “satisfactory and in line with international norms”.
At a ceremony on Oct 25 at Islamabad International Airport, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the resumption of flights to Britain was a major milestone in restoring PIA’s credibility.
“After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Mr Asif said.
He added that in the years since the British had imposed their ban, the Pakistani authorities overhauled pilot training, licensing, aircraft maintenance and safety protocols to meet international standards.
Beyond a twice-weekly route between Islamabad and Manchester, PIA plans to operate flights to London and Birmingham as well.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted its own ban on PIA in November 2024, allowing the airline to resume flights to Paris in January.
The flag carrier, which employs around 7,000 people, has long struggled with debt, mismanagement and regulatory issues.
The government has pledged to privatise the airline, though a deal collapsed in 2024 after a buyer reportedly offered far below the asking price.
Founded in 1955, PIA was once a symbol of national pride and rapid growth, but its reputation has eroded over decades of financial losses and safety lapses. AFP","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:58:25.899455

"Storm that caused turbulence on Scoot flight in 2024 was not detected on weather radar","https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/turbulence-that-hit-scoot-flight-in-sept-2024-seriously-hurting-2-not-detected-on-weather-radar?ref=search-results","Oct 18, 2025, 12:00 PM","SINGAPORE – The turbulence that shook a Scoot flight bound for Guangzhou from Singapore in September 2024, seriously injuring two, was likely due to a storm cell that did not appear on the plane’s weather radar.
Flight TR100, carrying 339 passengers and headed for Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, was hit by turbulence during its descent at about 8.40am on Sept 6, 2024. The seat-belt sign was off at the time.
Although Super Typhoon Yagi made landfall in Guangdong – of which Guangzhou is the capital – on the same day, it was far away and did not lead to the turbulence.
These details were made public in a Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) report dated Oct 4. The TSIB, a department in the Ministry of Transport, classified the occurrence as an accident.
The storm cell, situated behind the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner wide-body jet, was not detected by its weather radar, which is typically positioned at the nose of an aircraft to detect weather ahead.
The storm cell was also not visible from the cockpit windows.
The accident prompted Scoot to review its guidelines for operating in areas affected by typhoons, the report revealed.
Scoot’s updated guidelines state that seat-belt signs must be on from take-off until the point in a flight where an aircraft finishes its climb and transitions to cruising at its planned altitude. The sign must also be on from the point where a flight starts descending until landing.
Scoot also issued instructions on Oct 14, 2024, requiring flight and cabin crew to remind passengers to keep their seat belts fastened while seated and to avoid moving around when the signs are on, according to the report.
A new directive also emphasises the need for flight crew to ensure passengers and cabin crew remain seated during critical phases of flight, or when navigating near areas of poor weather conditions.
From Nov 1, 2024, the airline put the International Air Transport Association’s Turbulence Aware app on tablets or laptops used by pilots. The platform provides real-time data on turbulence.
Flight TR100 was a relatively smooth flight, with only patches of light turbulence, said the report, and its two pilots did not observe any bad weather on the radar or along the flight path.
At about 8am, one of the pilots switched off the seat-belt signs so passengers could use the toilets before descent, the report said.
As the weather radar remained clear, the pilot did not turn the seat-belt sign back on even as the plane began descending.
The aircraft had also not reached an altitude of 10,000 feet, at which point the flight crew would be required to turn on the seat-belt signs, the report noted.
At about 8.45am, when the aircraft was descending from an altitude of 18,700 feet, turbulence struck. The pilots switched on the seat-belt signs as soon as the turbulence was felt.
Eleven people were injured, including 10 of 11 cabin crew.
Two of them – a passenger and a cabin crew member – were seriously hurt. Nine cabin crew members had minor injuries.
The passenger underwent surgery at a hospital in Guangzhou for a fractured lumbar spinal bone in the lower back, while the crew member had right foot fractures and was operated on in Singapore.
In response to questions from The Straits Times, a Scoot spokeswoman said the airline “apologises to all customers for (their) experience on board flight TR100 on Sept 6, 2024, which encountered unexpected turbulence”.
She added: “The safety and well-being of our customers and staff are always Scoot’s top priority.”
Scoot will continue to review its operating procedures regularly and strengthen its safety protocols where appropriate, she said.
Meanwhile, in separate incidents, two private jets took off from Seletar Airport at night in 2024 while lined up on the edge of the runway, instead of the centre line.
The misaligned take-offs damaged runway lights and the jets themselves, according to a TSIB report dated Aug 27. TSIB classified both cases as serious incidents. Investigators found that the pilots had likely mistaken the lights on the right edge of the runway for the centre line while taking off.
The first incident on July 17, 2024, involved a Dassault Falcon 900EX jet bound for Muscat, Oman, operated by insurance and asset management company Allianz Se.
During take-off at about 9.22pm, the pilots heard a loud noise but continued the flight. After landing, damage to its nose landing gear, including a flat tyre and a protective door panel, was found.
A runway inspection in Singapore shortly after the flight took off found one damaged runway edge light near an adjoining taxiway, which connects the runway with other airport facilities.
Data from the aircraft’s flight recorder and airport CCTV showed that the jet had begun its take-off roll along the runway’s right edge.
A similar incident occurred less than three months later, on Oct 6, 2024, when a Bombardier Global 6000 jet operated by charter airline Luxaviation took off from the same runway bound for Bangalore, India.
After departure at 8.42pm, seven runway edge lights and one taxiway light were found damaged.
The aircraft landed safely, but checks revealed damage to its right main landing gear, including deep tyre cuts and hydraulic fluid leaks.
Investigators again found that the aircraft had rolled on the right-hand edge of the runway.
TSIB’s investigation pointed to reduced visibility and confusing visual cues as key factors in the misaligned take-offs.
Both incidents occurred at night, when the absence of natural light combined with the lack of runway centre-line lighting made it harder for pilots to orient themselves.
At the same time, bright white edge lights and the layout of a taxiway that leads into the runway may have visually misled the crews. Additionally, the paved area on the right side of the runway may have created a misleading impression of being positioned in the centre, the report said.
In the second incident, debris from the broken lights remained on the runway until after two other aircraft had landed.
Unlike Changi Airport, Seletar Airport does not have an automated Foreign Object Debris detection system and relies on visual reports and four daily manual inspections.
Changi Airport Group, which also manages Seletar Airport, has since issued safety notices reminding pilots to ensure proper alignment with the centre line.
The airport plans to shift the taxiway edge lights to reduce the likelihood of misalignment, with work expected to finish by the fourth quarter of 2025.
An airfield lighting system to detect failures will be in place by the first quarter of 2027. This will alert the runway inspection team to any faults and resulting debris.
TSIB also recommended that Seletar Airport adopt technologies to detect debris early.
Seletar Airport general manager Michael Lee told ST that safety is of utmost priority, and the airport’s infrastructure meets international standards and Singapore’s air navigation regulations.
“Notwithstanding (this), we have continued to actively review and enhance procedures in collaboration with airport partners and the pilots involved,” he said, adding that the airport remains committed to ensuring a safe environment for all users.
ST has contacted Allianz Se and Luxaviation for comment.","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:58:44.850262

The device, known as the ram air turbine, drops from the fuselage when a plane loses power or hydraulic pressure, and helps power critical systems such as flight controls and navigation instruments.
The device deployed during Air India Flight 117, which landed safely in Birmingham, England, on Oct 4.
Air India, the country’s largest air carrier, said in a statement that an initial inspection found that “all electrical and hydraulic parameters” were normal with the flight.
But the pilots’ association, the Federation of Indian Pilots, called for all Boeing 787s in use in India to undergo electrical inspection. Air India operates 34 Boeing 787s, according to a document on its website from April.
“I have never heard of the RAT (ram air turbine) being deployed automatically without any hydraulic loss, power loss or failures,” said Captain Charanvir Singh Randhawa, president of the association, which represents more than 6,000 pilots across India.
Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr Siddhant Chauhan, a Boeing spokesman, referred questions to India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, which did not immediately respond.
The flight on Oct 4 was the second time since June that a ram air turbine was deployed on an Air India Boeing 787.
On June 12, Air India Flight 171 also used the turbine on a flight headed to London, which crashed 30 seconds after take-off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. The crash killed 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground.
A preliminary report into that accident confirmed that the device activated when the plane lost power. But investigators are still working to determine whether the turbine was a symptom or a cause of the aircraft’s loss of power.
Mr Randhawa said the association had sent a letter on Oct 5 to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the national regulator, saying that an electrical fault could have caused the ram air turbine to deploy unexpectedly.
The agency has yet to publicly confirm whether it will investigate the Oct 4 Air India flight incident, and has also not responded to questions about the claims made by the pilots’ group. NYTIMES","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:59:19.762548

SIA and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said in a joint statement on Sept 4 that the video will progressively be screened on all SIA flights from end-October.
In the 5min 39sec-long video, viewers follow two SIA cabin crew members on their journey around Singapore, which begins at Gardens by the Bay’s Cloud Forest.
Along the way, they enlist the help of local communities – such as a lion dance troupe, kolam artists, silat practitioners and an aqua aerobics team – to demonstrate in-flight safety procedures.
At Jurong Lake Gardens, for instance, a lion dance performer demonstrates take-off and landing procedures, including securing tray tables and positioning seats upright.
Viewers are then taken to a Housing Board flat, where a family feasting on durians at the dinner table demonstrates how to use an oxygen mask.
The video goes on to feature locations such as Tanjong Beach on Sentosa, the Village Hotel Sentosa and Lau Pa Sat, before rounding off at the Esplanade. It then pans out with an aerial view of Singapore’s famous night skyline.
Mr Vinod Kannan, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at SIA, said he hopes the video resonates with those living in Singapore and “evokes a sense of home whenever they watch it on board”.
He added that each scene was carefully designed to reinforce essential safety messages, as safety remains the airline’s absolute priority.
The video combines real-life footage with watercolour effects, which SIA and STB said draws inspiration from Singapore’s vibrant arts landscape.
Mr Kenneth Lim, STB’s marketing group assistant chief executive, said its strategic partnership with SIA allows Singapore’s distinct character to be showcased to millions of travellers worldwide, and reinforces Singapore’s position as a preferred destination for business and leisure.

AirAsia Flight QZ545 departed at about 6.30pm, reported Australian news outlet 9News. It circled near Rottnest Island, off the coast of western Australia, and burned fuel to make it a safe weight for landing before touching down at the airport.
The Airbus A320 was carrying 108 passengers and six crew members, AirAsia said in a statement published on its website on Aug 25.
9News reported that passengers saw flames coming out of an engine. The news outlet said a passenger sitting in the exit row reported seeing an explosion and flames, initially thinking it was lightning.
A video uploaded by 9News shows flashes of orange light illuminating one of the plane’s engines mid-flight.
“Shortly after take-off, the flight crew observed an abnormality in one of the engines, which was swiftly stabilised in accordance with standard operating procedures,” AirAsia said.
“After assessing the situation, the crew decided to conduct a turnback in line with operational safety and completed all required checklists before landing safely at Perth Airport.”
The aircraft landed safely at about 7.50pm local time. Passengers and crew members disembarked the aircraft without incident, said the airline.
AirAsia Indonesia’s chief executive Achmad Sadikin said the incident was a “precautionary turnback” and that the crew responded swiftly and in full accordance with established procedures.
The crew kept passengers informed throughout the situation and arrangements were made to support their needs at the airport, he added.
Alternative arrangements were made for all passengers to fly on Flight QZ547, which departed Perth at 3.29am on Aug 25 and arrived in Denpasar, Bali, at 7.26am local time, Captain Achmad said.

"United Airlines grounds flights at US airports over tech glitch","https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/united-airlines-grounds-flights-at-us-airports-over-technology-glitch?ref=search-results","Aug 7, 2025, 10:05 AM","WASHINGTON – United Airlines said it had grounded its flights at US airports on Aug 6 due to a technology issue and warned of additional flight delays in the evening.
“Due to a technology issue, we are holding United mainline flights at their departure airports,” the airline said.
United suffered an outage of its weight calculation system, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
“The issue affecting United Airlines flights has been resolved and mainline flights are departing once again,” flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said on social media at 9.19pm Eastern Time (9.19am Singapore time, Aug 7).
The US Federal Aviation Administration said earlier that it had issued a ground stop for United flights at several US airports.
The ground stops were issued at major United hub airports including Newark, Denver, Houston and Chicago, according to the regulator’s website.
As at 9.25pm Eastern Time, flight tracking data from FlightAware showed that 870, or 28 per cent, of United flights had been delayed on Aug 6.
United’s outage came a few weeks after Alaska Airlines grounded all of its flights for about three hours due to an information technology outage for the second time in just over a year.
In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes. REUTERS","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:59:37.582159
"‘For one last time, let’s go home’: Tears, laughs as last scheduled Jetstar Asia flight touches down","https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/for-one-last-time-lets-go-home-tears-laughs-as-last-scheduled-jetstar-asia-flight-touches-down?ref=search-results","Jul 31, 2025, 10:35 PM","SINGAPORE – Mr Norazman Sapiie had tears in his eyes and a smile on his face as he readied the aircraft for departure, for the last time in his 20-year career as a flight attendant with Jetstar Asia.
After blowing kisses and waving goodbye to ground staff who had gathered on the tarmac and the aerobridge at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the in-flight customer service manager took a deep breath, eyes closed as he turned away from the door.
As the aircraft picked up speed and lifted off, Mr Norazman said: “Cabin crew, for one last time, let’s go home.”
Mr Norazman, 57, is Jetstar Asia’s longest-serving flight attendant, after joining the airline in October 2004.
The flight he was operating, 3K764, was Jetstar Asia’s last scheduled flight as the curtain fell on the budget carrier, more than 20 years since its maiden flight in December 2004.
It departed Manila slightly behind schedule at about 6pm, with 156 passengers and seven crew members aboard the Airbus A320.
There was rousing applause from passengers after the flight touched down at Changi Airport at 9.18pm.
The Straits Times was invited to be on board the flight.
Jetstar Asia announced in June that it would stop operations on July 31 and retrench more than 500 employees, including over 100 pilots and nearly 300 cabin crew.
Australian flag carrier Qantas, its parent company, said rising costs and stiff competition in the region had dented Jetstar Asia’s ability to offer low fares.
The first time Ms Tikka Cheung, 35, flew Jetstar Asia, it was out of necessity, as she had missed an AirAsia flight bound for Kuala Lumpur.
That flight kick-started many trips with the airline for Ms Cheung, a teacher from Hong Kong.
When she heard of Jetstar Asia’s closure, she was determined to be on the final flight “for the memories”, she told ST before boarding.
She landed in Manila in the early hours of July 31 with her friend Herman Yip, also 35. The pair had travelled from Hong Kong to be on the last flight.
“It’s a very sad moment,” said Mr Yip, an aviation enthusiast who works for a travel media company in Hong Kong.
He carried on board a flight logbook that he asks crew on “special flights” to fill in, including details such as how many passengers were on board.
Also aboard were Mrs Jester Agarrado, 45, and her 18-year-old son Josh, who had also specially travelled to Manila to take Jetstar Asia’s final flight.
Mrs Agarrado’s husband, Captain Roy Espinosa Agarrado, has been a pilot at Jetstar Asia for 18 years and travelled on Flight 3K764 as a passenger.
“I want to show my support for Roy and the Jetstar Asia crew,” she said. “He has worked so hard for the past 18 years.”
Josh was only a few months old when the family, hailing from the Philippines, relocated to Singapore for his father’s job.
He said: “My dad’s been working hard (my whole life)… this is the least I can do for my dad, to show him that I care.” Josh wants to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a pilot.
For housewife Joy Garcia, it was her first time flying Jetstar Asia – and also her last.
She said it was memorable to be on the final flight. “I’m happy, but at the same time, I’m sad,” said the 42-year-old, who is from the Philippines and is based in Singapore.
While waiting to board, her five-year-old son Jodel made a poster encouraging Jetstar Asia staff.
Mr Barathan Pasupathi, a former chief executive of Jetstar Asia who helmed the airline from July 2012 to February 2024, was also on board.
He said he was joining the last flight in his personal capacity.
“It’s extremely personal for me,” said Mr Barathan, now chief executive of Jazeera Airways, a low-cost airline in Kuwait.
Speaking to ST before boarding Flight 3K764, he said: “It is a final chapter for Jetstar Asia, and I wanted to be there for the airline, and more so for the people.
“Singapore is going to lose a star, but the people will carry on.”
In an announcement before the plane made its descent, Mr Norazman thanked “every passenger who walked through our doors”.
“You have not just filled our seats; you have filled our hearts,” he said, pausing to blink back tears.
Captain Mark Yeo, the commander of the flight, made a similar announcement before the plane started its descent into Singapore, drawing cheers and applause from passengers.
“It’s a bitter-sweet feeling,” Capt Yeo, 53, told ST from the cockpit, minutes after landing the aircraft. He said he was honoured to helm the final flight.
Capt Yeo has been a pilot at Jetstar Asia for 18 years.
After landing, Mr Norazman said into the public address system, to laughs from passengers and crew: “Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, after today, we will be ‘funemployed’.”
The crew received a hero’s welcome from hundreds of people waiting at the arrival hall. Chants of “Jetstar, Jetstar” were heard, with cheers erupting every time a crew member walked out.
The largest cheers were for Mr Norazman, who could not control his tears when those gathered started chanting his name, and pulling him into hugs and selfies.
“The welcome was so overwhelming. I’m out of tears now,” he said, adding that it was hard to describe the intensity of the moment the wheels hit the tarmac, with the last flight now over.
“After 20 years, it’s hard to let go for the last time... I feel so blessed to have the people that are around me.”
Waiting just outside the aircraft to welcome the crew home was Jetstar Asia chief executive John Simeone, who said the day had been an emotional one. “We are all really proud of just what (the crew) have achieved over the years,” he added.
Owing to a delay, another Jetstar Asia flight from Labuan Bajo in Indonesia landed after Flight 3K764, closing a chapter for the airline.","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:59:44.601586
"SIA, Scoot, Cathay Pacific cancel flights as typhoon nears Hong Kong","https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/cathay-pacific-cancels-sunday-flights-as-typhoon-nears-hong-kong?ref=search-results","Jul 19, 2025, 6:30 PM","HONG KONG - Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways delayed and cancelled flights in and out of Hong Kong on July 20 as tropical cyclone Wipha approached the city.
According to the Singapore carrier’s website, two flights to Hong Kong from Changi Airport on July 20 have been cancelled – SQ874 and SQ882.
Another three flights from Hong Kong which were due to land in Singapore on the same day have also been cancelled – SQ899, SQ875 and SQ883.
SIA also said that two flights on July 20 will be rescheduled to a later time.
SQ892, which was originally set to depart Singapore for Hong Kong at 9.50am, will be pushed back to 11.50am.
Meanwhile, SQ893 from Hong Kong to Singapore will now similarly depart two hours later at 5.40pm, instead of 3.40pm.
The impending storm has also led to the cancellation of two flights (SQ856 and SQ857) between Singapore and Shenzhen, which is near Hong Kong.
“As the situation remains fluid, other SIA flights between Singapore, Shenzhen and Hong Kong may be affected,” the airline said on its website.
Separately, low-cost carrier Scoot said in a media reply that it has cancelled two flights between Singapore and Macau on July 20 due to the typhoon – TR904 and TR905.
The Singaporean carrier said it will help affected customers rebook on other flights, or refund them on request.
On July 19, Cathay Pacific said that all flights scheduled to arrive at or depart from the Hong Kong International Airport between 5am and 6pm will either be delayed or cancelled.
The company will rebook alternatives for affected customers, according to its statement.
The Hong Kong Observatory said it would issue typhoon Signal 8, the third-highest level, in the early hours of July 20.
As Wipha moves closer to the coast of Guangdong, winds will strengthen and there will be frequent heavy showers and thunderstorms in the region, according to the Observatory.
The Education Bureau said all special classes and other school events would be suspended on July 20.
The Airport Authority expects that many flights will be affected and that it will take one to two days for them to fully return to schedule, a representative said in a media briefing. BLOOMBERG

Flight SQ246 had departed Brisbane Airport on the night of July 7 and was originally scheduled to arrive at Changi Airport at 5.45am the following morning.
Flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed the plane leaving Brisbane, on the eastern coast of Australia, and travelling towards Broome on the north-western edge of the country before turning south.
In response to queries, SIA said the Airbus A350-900 experienced a technical issue and landed uneventfully in Perth with 272 passengers and 15 crew members at 4.58am local time.
The aircraft required a spare part and additional repair time, Australian publication The West Australian reported a SIA spokesperson as saying.
Passengers were given food and drinks while waiting for a replacement aircraft, the SIA spokesperson added.
Flight SQ246 was then renumbered SQ9224 and departed Perth on July 8 at around 4.40pm local time and was estimated to arrive in Singapore at around 9.40pm.
“We are providing all necessary assistance to the affected passengers, including the rebooking of connecting flights and hotel accommodation in Singapore, if required,” the SIA spokesperson said.
“SIA sincerely apologises to all affected passengers for any inconvenience caused.”","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 14:59:57.022023
"Aerobridge hits Qantas plane at Sydney Airport, damaging engine, delaying flight","https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/aerobridge-hits-qantas-plane-at-sydney-airport-damaging-engine-delaying-flight?ref=search-results","Jul 12, 2025, 8:30 PM","A Qantas flight from Sydney to Johannesburg was delayed by 21 hours on July 12 after an aerobridge struck the aircraft during ground operations, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.
The incident took place at Sydney Airport’s international terminal, where Qantas flight QF 63 was preparing to depart for South Africa’s largest city at 9.30am local time (7.30am Singapore time).
During the process, an aerobridge hit the Airbus A380 at its departure gate, according to reports.
The aerobridge functions as a movable walkway. It can extend, retract and pivot to align perfectly with different aircraft doors, allowing passengers to board and disembark efficiently.
Images posted on social media show one of the Airbus A380’s four Rolls-Royce engines pierced by the aerobridge’s support beam.
No injuries were reported. Passengers on board were safely disembarked from the lower deck of the double-decker aircraft, Qantas said.
According to a report by Australian broadcaster ABC News, the national carrier said it would provide overnight accommodation and transport in Sydney to passengers affected by the delay, if required.
The flight, which typically takes about 15 hours to reach Johannesburg, was carrying about three-quarters of its capacity of more than 480 passengers, ABC reported.
It is now expected to depart at 6.30am local time on July 13 instead.
Engineers are currently assessing the damage, and the aircraft will be repaired before it re-enters service with the airline’s international fleet.
Sydney Airport said it was working closely with Qantas to support the impacted travellers.
“Earlier today there was an incident involving a Qantas aircraft making contact with an aerobridge during ground operations,” the airport said in a statement.","Straits_Times",2025-11-02 15:00:04.052756
